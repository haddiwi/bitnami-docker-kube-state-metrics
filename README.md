# What is Kube-state-metrics?

kube-state-metrics is a simple service that listens to the Kubernetes API server and generates metrics about the state of the objects. (See examples in the Metrics section below.) It is not focused on the health of the individual Kubernetes components, but rather on the health of the various objects inside, such as deployments, nodes and pods.

The metrics are exported through the Prometheus golang client on the HTTP endpoint /metrics on the listening port (default 80). They are served either as plaintext or protobuf depending on the Accept header. They are designed to be consumed either by Prometheus itself or by a scraper that is compatible with scraping a Prometheus client endpoint. You can also open /metrics in a browser to see the raw metrics.

# TL;DR

Deploy Kube-state-metrics on your [Kubernetes cluster](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/tree/master/Documentation).

# Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading Linux distribution.
* All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Docker Content Trust (DCT)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/content_trust/). You can use `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1` to verify the integrity of the images.
* Bitnami container images are released daily with the latest distribution packages available.

# Why use a non-root container?

Non-root container images add an extra layer of security and are generally recommended for production environments. However, because they run as a non-root user, privileged tasks are typically off-limits. Learn more about non-root containers [in our docs](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/work-with-non-root-containers/).

# Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

Learn more about the Bitnami tagging policy and the difference between rolling tags and immutable tags [in our documentation page](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/understand-rolling-tags-containers/).


* [`2`, `2-debian-10`, `2.2.1`, `2.2.1-debian-10-r5`, `latest` (2/debian-10/Dockerfile)](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-kube-state-metrics/blob/2.2.1-debian-10-r5/2/debian-10/Dockerfile)

# Get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami Kube-state-metrics Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/kube-state-metrics).

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/kube-state-metrics:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the [list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/kube-state-metrics/tags/) in the Docker Hub Registry.

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/kube-state-metrics:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself.

```console
$ docker build -t bitnami/kube-state-metrics:latest 'https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-kube-state-metrics.git#master:2/debian-10'
```

# Configuration

## Resource recommendation

Resource usage changes with the size of the cluster. As a general rule, you should allocate

* 200MiB memory
* 0.1 cores

For clusters of more than 100 nodes, allocate at least

* 2MiB memory per node
* 0.001 cores per node
